  `To protect the privacy and important information of the company I am working in, 
  I cannot disclose any confidential information. However,
  I can share some of the code best practices that I have learn throughout my expreriences 
  as a Full Stack Developer. Working in my current company allows me to use unit testing library such as PHPunit test and jasmine.
  I was actively using the jasmine library during the time that I was coding in Angular.
  I also have the opportunity of enhancing my code using the Sonarcube. With the help of the challenges I've been through, I honed myself
  with writing reusable and well organized codes that can be used for other incoming projects, especially in React.`;

`New Born application is my sample project built in React, Laravel, and Tailwind. The purpose of this app is to save data of
new born babies and allow the manipulation of created data all through out the application using the CRUD, notification system,
and search function. This app has the ability to segregate the records using specimen statuses and filter them from another page
before navigation. For the authentication system, I have used JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with registration process.`;
