  `To protect companies' privacy, I cannot share specific project links or names, 
  but I can share the virtues I have learned from them. Most of my output and participation 
  were indulged in company projects. Through these experiences, I was able to learn and adapt 
  some of the best practices in web application development, utilizing tools such as SonarCube and 
  unit testing library for ensuring all the implementations are working and bug free. Learning independently 
  to enhance my skills rapidly is a practice I've been following, but I truly value the importance of teamwork, 
  as it provides me with the right vision on how I can learn from other approaches to address various technical challenges.`;
